# ChromaFind
This project uses the OpenCV library to access the webcam and detect objects of specific colors in the video stream. The code captures a video frame from the webcam, converts it to the HSV color space, and then applies color thresholds to extract objects of specific colors from the frame.

To change the code to detect a different color, you need to modify the lower and upper bounds of the color range in the HSV color space. You can do this by adjusting the values in the lower_ and upper_ arrays.
-->Choose the color you want to detect and its corresponding values in the HSV color space. You can use a color picker tool or reference a color chart to obtain the HSV values;
-->Replace the values in the lower_ and upper_ arrays with the new values for your desired color.

Possible applications of this project - 

1. Quality control: In manufacturing or production environments, a color-detecting project can be used to ensure that products meet certain quality standards. For example, a project that detects the correct color of a certain part can ensure that the part has been manufactured correctly and is ready for use.

2. Image recognition: Color detection is an important part of image recognition and processing. Projects that detect specific colors can be used to identify objects or parts of objects within an image. For example, a color-detecting project could be used to locate and track a specific colored object in a surveillance video.

3. Medical diagnosis: In medical applications, color detection can be used to identify specific conditions or diseases. For example, a project that detects changes in skin color could be used to diagnose certain skin conditions or illnesses.

4. Environmental monitoring: Color detection can also be useful in environmental monitoring. For example, a project that detects the color of water in a stream or river could be used to monitor water quality and detect pollution.

5. Accessibility: Color detection can be used to assist people with color blindness or other visual impairments. For example, a project that detects the colors of traffic lights could provide audio or visual cues to help people with color blindness navigate safely through intersections.
